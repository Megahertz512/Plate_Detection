    "\n",
    "**Objective:**  \n",
    "1. Create and label a dataset for detecting car plates.\n",
    "2. Train a YOLOv5 model to detect the full car plate.\n",
    "3. Crop the detected car plates and manually label the characters on them.\n",
    "4. Train a YOLOv5 model to detect individual characters (digits/letters) on car plates.\n",

    "### Part 1: Dataset Creation and Car Plate Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dataset Collection:**\n",
    "    - Students must collect a set of images that feature cars with visible license plates. \n",
    "    - The dataset should contain diverse backgrounds and weather conditions to make the model robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Labeling Car Plates:**\n",
    "   - Using a labeling tool like **LabelImg** or **Label Studio**, students must create bounding box annotations for **entire car plates** in each image.\n",
    "     - Ensure that the label for each bounding box is “plate”.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Train YOLOv5 for Car Plate Detection:**\n",
    "   - Install YOLOv5 and set up the training environment (you can provide the [YOLOv5 setup guide](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) for reference).\n",
    "   - Train the YOLOv5 model to detect the car plates from the labeled dataset.\n",
    "     - Ensure they use the correct parameters and configurations for training, such as specifying the dataset, classes, and image size.\n",
    "     - Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics like precision, recall, and mAP (mean average precision).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluation:**\n",
    "   - After training, students should test the model on new, unseen images and check if it detects car plates accurately.\n",
    "   - Students should report evaluation results, including any difficulties encountered (e.g., issues with angle, partial plates, blurry images).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Part 2: Character Detection on Car Plates\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Crop Detected Car Plates:**\n",
    "   - For each detected car plate, crop the plate from the original image using the bounding box coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Labeling Individual Characters:**\n",
    "   - Students will need to manually label the **individual characters** on each cropped car plate. This can be done using **LabelImg** or **Label Studio** as well.\n",
    "     - The label for each bounding box should be the character (e.g., \"A\", \"1\", \"X\").\n",
    "     - The goal is to have a separate bounding box for each character on the car plate (e.g., a license plate like “ABC 123” will have six bounding boxes: one for each letter/number).\n",
    "     - Include multiple images with different characters (digits and letters) to train a robust character detection model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training YOLOv5 for Character Detection:**\n",
    "   - Using the labeled dataset of individual characters, train a YOLOv5 model specifically for detecting characters on the car plates.\n",
    "     - Each image will now contain a cropped car plate, and each label will correspond to one character.\n",
    "   - Evaluate the model to ensure that it correctly detects individual characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluation and Visual Results:**\n",
    "   - After training, students should test the model on unseen car plates and visually verify that the characters are correctly detected (i.e., each digit/letter is enclosed in a bounding box).\n",
    "   - Provide images that show both the plate and the detected characters with bounding boxes, along with the final evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
