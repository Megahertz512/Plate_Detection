# Vehicle License Plate Detection with YOLO

This project involves designing and training a model for vehicle license plate detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. The goal was to accurately identify license plates from images with high efficiency and short processing times.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection
- A dataset of 300 images of vehicles under various conditions (lighting, angles, and backgrounds) was collected.  
- The images were manually annotated to mark the license plate locations in each image.

### 2. Model Training
- YOLO was selected as the primary algorithm for object detection.  
- The dataset was split into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets.  
- The model was trained using popular deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.
